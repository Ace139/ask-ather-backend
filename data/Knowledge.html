The reason why this is done is because charging your scooter to 100% every day can put a lot of stress on the battery, which can lead to a decrease in battery health over time. This is because charging the battery to 100% causes lithium ions to settle at the bottom of the battery, which can lead to a decrease in battery capacity over time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0">The optimized charging feature helps to mitigate this issue by charging the battery only up to 80% during the time window between 6 pm and 1 am.

The number of kilometers, driving style, charging behavior, and a few other factors impact the battery life. However, on average, Ather batteries are expected to last for 5 years or more, with over 70% capacity. This data is based on our internal testing vehicles and on-road vehicles. We provide a battery warranty of 3 years for unlimited km &ndash; the battery will be replaced under warranty if it dips below 70% capacity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Ather Battery pack has a warranty of 5 years or 60000 kms, whichever comes first,with a performance assurance of 70% which is an industry first (Available only in Pro pack). The battery life is approximately 2000 charging cycles. ie. With a True Range of ~100 Kms, it will power rides up to 2,00,000 Kms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">100% coverage against defects &amp; failures which Covers any and all possible electronic failures in the battery The way a warranty should.. There&#39;s no limit to your riding experience. Which is why, your claim amounts won&#39;t be limited either. Idle state assurance covers any and all possible electronic failures in the battery. </span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c9 lst-kix_nixxtb7ihcto-0" start="52"><li class="c2 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Ride Modes</span></li></ol><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The electric scooter also has four riding modes - Eco, Ride, Sports, and Warp - to choose from depending on your needs. </span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ather scooters offer five ride modes, each catering to a different riding style and need:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">1. Warp Mode: This is the most powerful mode, offering the fastest acceleration and top range 75 km (3.7 kwh) and Warp- 60 km(2.9 kwh). Use it for short bursts of excitement or when you need to get somewhere in a hurry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">2. Sport Mode: This mode provides a good balance of power and efficiency. It&#39;s perfect for everyday riding, with a top speed of around 70 km. You&#39;ll get a good range on a single charge in this mode.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">3. Ride Mode: This is the most balanced mode, offering moderate power and acceleration with a top speed of around 60 km/h. It&#39;s a good choice for most situations, providing a comfortable and enjoyable riding experience.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">4. Eco Mode: This mode prioritizes efficiency over power, with a top speed of around 45 km/h. You&#39;ll get the maximum range on a single charge in this mode, making it ideal for long commutes or when you&#39;re running low on battery.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">5. SmartEco Mode: This mode automatically adjusts the power and acceleration based on your riding conditions, such as your speed and battery level. It&#39;s a good option if you&#39;re not sure which mode to use or if you want to maximize your range while still having some fun.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The best mode for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. If you&#39;re looking for the most power and speed, Warp Mode is the way to go. But if you&#39;re more concerned about range, Eco Mode is the best choice. And if you want a good balance of both, Sport Mode or Ride Mode are good options.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Incentives</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME II), is a scheme launched by the Government of India to give a boost to development of Electric Vehicles.
